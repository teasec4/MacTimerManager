# ⏱ MacTimerV1

A lightweight **macOS timer app** built with SwiftUI.
The goal is to keep time tracking simple while also providing history and insights.

---

## ✨ Features
- 🔹 Create multiple timers with custom **names** and **icons**
- 🔹 Start, pause, and stop timers individually
- 🔹 **Compact Mode**: minimal floating window for focus
- 🔹 Save sessions into **History** with date and duration
- 🔹 Activity heatmap for the **last 7 days** (like GitHub contributions)
- 🔹 Local persistence with `UserDefaults`

## 🎯 Purpose
I wanted a clean and distraction-free tool to:
- Track different activities (work, study, training, etc.)
- Save sessions and see how I actually spend my time
- Get a quick overview of productivity across days
